# Flash Timers
Track when the enemy in League of Legends has flash up with the press of a single button! Definitely want to 
have a second monitor for the best experience. Could still work with one monitor but you would need to be constantly
alt-tabbing.

# Usage
F6 - starts top timer <br/>
F7 - starts jungle timer <br/>
F8 - starts mid timer <br/>
F9 - starts bot timer <br/>
F10 - starts support timer <br/>

NOTE: F9 is already binded to "Toggle Mouse Screen Lock" by default in League of Legends. This keybind allows you to move your mouse freely without being restricted to the actual window the game occupies. It also displays a red box/border around the window when turned on. Definitely change this keybind to something else otherwise you might get griefed by it in-game (found in Hotkeys -> Menus).
