# Flash Timers
Track when the enemy in League of Legends has flash up with the press of a single button! Definitely want to 
have a second monitor for the best experience. Could still work with one monitor but you would need to be constantly
alt-tabbing.

# Usage
F6 - starts top timer <br/>
F7 - starts jungle timer <br/>
F8 - starts mid timer <br/>
F9 - starts bot timer <br/>
F10 - starts support timer <br/>
